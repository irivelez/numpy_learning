# NumPy Learning Repository

This repository contains my work following the official NumPy: the absolute basics for beginners tutorial. The goal is to practice fundamental NumPy concepts and operations.

## Contents

* `numpy_quickstart.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code exercises and notes from the tutorial.

## Source

The exercises are based on the tutorial found at: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html

## Environment

This code was run using Python managed via Anaconda, typically within the `base (root)` environment which includes NumPy.
